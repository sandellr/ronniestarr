							<h2>HISTORY</h2>
							<p>What really happened?</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Levy-yhtiö Records had shown interest towards Ronnie Starr from the beginning, but in the fall of 2001, after yet another recording session to become the bands third self paid release, serious discussions to sign the band began. The third release was cancelled and it was decided that a new recording session was to take place, this time at Finnvox studios and with producer Pekka Laine and recording engineer Dan Tigerstedt. So, in November 2002 Ronnie Starr took a huge step forward as Levy-yhtiö released their first official single "The Dance / Miss Moonshine". The foursome promoted the single by touring Finland as the opening act for Apulanta.</p>

							<p>In the spring 2003, Ronnie Starr got Lasse Kurki, the vocalist and guitarist of Lemonator, to produce their debut album. Under Lasse’s influence and guidance the group enthusiastically stepped into the studio and the fruits of the co-operation were ready for everyone to enjoy when "First Take" was released in September 2003.</p>

							<p>The album title became self evident when Lasse said: "I don’t know what it is with you guys, but you always seem to do the best job on the first take." The eleven smashing songs are soaked with catchy melodies and performed with a sweaty seventies’ attitude. Two singles were released off the album and both fared well on the radio waves.</p>

							<p>In the autumn 2003, Ronnie Starr made their first video. The song was Rock ‘n’ Roll Dreams and it got great reviews from the audience as well as from the critics in Levyraati in January 2004 (Levyraati is a music programme on Finnish telly - some well-known people criticising songs and music videos).</p>

							<p>"In Full Swing!!" landed in stores September 8th 2004. The ep hit the charts at it’s debut week, finishing number four on the official Finnish chart and number two on Free Record Shop’s internal single chart. A song from the ep, Sour Love, got lots of airtime as well. Both Sour Love and An Avenue from "First Take" reached the number one position on Radio Suomipop’s Top30-chart. Another ep, "Evil And Simple" followed soon in February 2005. Once again, the ep went to the official singles charts and received good airplay. Ronnie Starr signed a record deal with Bianca-Pop Music in 2007 and released the album "Off The City". The album featured the digitally released single titled "Living Off the City".</p>
                           
                            <p>Now, twenty years after their first rehearsals, they are here again to entertain!</p>
